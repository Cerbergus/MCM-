# MCM-
Model for MCM preparation(personal use)
A collection of example models for conts & discrete type of question are expected to be posted on this repository someday soon.


IDEAL SCHEDULE:

Day1:

1. Search for literature and determine the question;
2. Determine the general framework of the article, data collection and processing; 3. Write the background of the problem and restate the problem.


Day2:

1. The first question's model establishment and algorithm analysis, and the second question's approach 
2. Hypothesis and explanation, model preparation part, first question paper writing;


Day 3:

1. The second question's model establishment and algorithm analysis, and the third question's approach.
2. Closing the first question and writing the paper for the second question;

Day 4 + all nighter : 
1. The third question model establishment and algorithm analysis;
2. Sensitivity analysis and robustness test, conclusion, summary,
3. Write non-technical reports;
